[CentOS](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos/) based base image with Oracle JDK 8.

Inspired by [lwieske/java-8](https://hub.docker.com/r/lwieske/java-8/), but with fewer layers.

**Using the image, you accept the [Oracle Binary Code License Agreement](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html) for Java SE.**

The base `centos:7` is subject to rolling updates, so this image should also be rebuilt periodically.
